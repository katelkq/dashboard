Future Directions
=================

Things that aren't currently supported, but are probably worth diving into in the future.


Deployment
----------

https://docs.bokeh.org/en/latest/docs/user_guide/server/deploy.html seems to be a good place to start. I haven't checked anything beyond this ;)


Development
-----------

Below are a few possible development directions:

- TODO
- local caches of api query results
- extend to advanced dataset
- color scope
- extend time range
- missing data indicator

I've also littered the source file with :code:`TODO`; some of them might make sense. So feel free to also check that out!
